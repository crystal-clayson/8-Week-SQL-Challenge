## Introduction
Foodie Fi is a food focused subscription based streaming service with video content from around the world focused on food. They offer several subscription plans- basic monthly, pro monthly, and pro yearly. Every customer gets a one week free trial before beginning the paid subscription of their choice.

The ```plans``` table lists the ```plan_id```, ```plan_name```, and ```price```. 'Churn' is included as a plan to indicate when a customer cancels their subscription.
